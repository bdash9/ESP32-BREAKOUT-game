# ESP32-BREAKOUT-game

Here is a little clone of the old classic arcade game Breakout!

I used an Adafuit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather, Thonny (MicroPython) and some basic Arcade buttons.

I started with some code I found online but I can't remember where! I am sorry about that. The code is fairly modified but I wish I could site my original source.
